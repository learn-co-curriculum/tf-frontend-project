# Front-End Prework Project

Congratulations! You've reached the end of your first big unit! It's time for your first project.
The task is simple: Using your newly-acquired front-end ninja skills, build out a personal website.
THe site should consist of a home page and at least 4 sub-pages (for example, bio, teaching philosophy, hobbies, photos, etc). You should be writing HTML, CSS (both bootstrap and custom css), and (optionally) javascript to put this together.

Send us your code when you think it's good to go!
